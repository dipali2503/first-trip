            The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) is an international legal agreement between all the member nations of the World Trade Organization (WTO). <br>It sets down minimum standards for the regulation
            by national governments of many forms of intellectual property (IP) as applied to nationals of other WTO member nations.<br><br>[3] TRIPS was negotiated at the end of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) between
            1989 and 1990[4] and is administered by the WTO. <br>The TRIPS agreement introduced intellectual property law into the multilateral trading system for the first time and remains the most comprehensive multilateral agreement on intellectual
            property to date.<br><br> In 2001, developing countries, concerned that developed countries were insisting on an overly narrow reading of TRIPS, initiated a round of talks that resulted in the Doha Declaration.<br> The Doha declaration is
            a WTO statement that clarifies the scope of TRIPS, stating for example that TRIPS can and should be interpreted in light of the goal "to promote access to medicines for all."<br><br> Specifically, TRIPS requires WTO members to provide copyright
            rights, covering authors and other copyright holders, as well as holders of related rights, namely performers, sound recording producers and broadcasting organisations; geographical indications; industrial designs; integrated circuit layout-designs;
            patents; new plant varieties; trademarks; trade names and undisclosed or confidential information.<br> TRIPS also specifies enforcement procedures, remedies, and dispute resolution procedures. <br><br>Protection and enforcement of all intellectual
            property rights shall meet the objectives to contribute to the promotion of technological innovation and to the transfer and dissemination of technology, to the mutual advantage of producers and users of technological knowledge and in a manner
            conducive to social and economic welfare, and to a balance of rights and obligations.
